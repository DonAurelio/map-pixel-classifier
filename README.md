# MAP PIXEL CLASSIFIER

This project deploys two machine learning models: **Multi Layer Perceptron** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**for satelite image classification. It supports only geotif files generated by the [Colombian Geoescience Datacube](http://cdcol.ideam.gov.co/) for uploading and land cover classification. The aforementined model perform pixel classification over the uploaded images. Land cover is classified in one of 4 clases (water,forest,water_or_forest,unclasified).
